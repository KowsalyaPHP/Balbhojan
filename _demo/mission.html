            Children are a nation’s greatest
            asset and most precious treasure. Providing for their physical, mental and spiritual
            needs is our responsibility.<br /><br />
            Balbhojan seeks to leverage a scalable Information Technology Platform, the Power of Networking and Basic
            Human Goodness
            to facilitate “easy giving” and “responsible taking” with high level of visibility to the donors at low and
            very
            prudent administrative costs. The entire process is “evidence based”.<br /><br />
            Be the bridge between those less fortunate, who need sustenance and succor and those who the ability and
            desire to reach
            out to their brethren that need their support.<br /><br /> Expand the network of donors and those receiving
            donations in
            a phased manner, so that irrespective of caste, religion, community, etc. the needy get timely and apt help.
