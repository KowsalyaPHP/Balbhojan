            Empowering young individuals to create a community of oneness, of sharing each other’s resources to bring
            about a change in their neighborhood.

            We have instilled it to our receivers that they need to give back to the society in their own capacity through
            any medium of their choice. We let kids identify the requirements and lend their helping hand to another
            peer. When we encourage a child to break from poverty and share their strengths with others, the ripple
            effect becomes powerful – right? Let the future champs lead.
