            Three like-minded people with a strong conviction to contribute towards the holistic development of children laid
            the foundations for Balbhojan, We at Balbhojan word towards building a better future for all the young people
            of our society by screening each one of their needs through our partner/volunteer network and then connecting
            them to a donor for financial support. We believe that every child’s voice needs to be heard and beyond the social
            constructs of caste, sexuality or religion. They deserve to be loved, cared and guided towards a happy future.

                ‘Balbhojan’ – the name connotes ‘food for children’. Going beyond the iteral meaning and expanding the scope
                of the words, we believe in providing food, clothing, shelter, education, health, mental growth and stimulus,
                caring, a sense of responsibility, the ability and the desire to extend their hands to other in their own
                ways. And though we started out, keeping children in mind, we have had occasions to help deserving adults
                too, who in turn contribute to child welfare – perhaps within their own families or others in their neighborhood.
